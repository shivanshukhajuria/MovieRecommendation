# MovieRecommendation
This is a python based movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their past viewing history and ratings. This system aim to provide personalized recommendations to users, helping them discover new movies that they may be interested in. The data is preprocessed and cleaned using libraries such as Pandas, and then fed into a machine learning model for training. The system utilizes collaborative filtering and matrix factorization to make recommendations by finding similar users and recommending movies that they have liked.
Collaborative filtering involves finding similar users and recommending movies that they have liked. This is done by calculating the similarity between users based on their ratings for different movies.
Matrix factorization, on the other hand, involves decomposing the rating matrix into latent features, which can then be used to make recommendations.

To use the movie recommendation system, follow these steps:
1. Download the dataset from here
2. Train the recommendation model
3. Once the model is trained, you can make recommendations

This movie recommendation system was developed as a group project with my friend.
